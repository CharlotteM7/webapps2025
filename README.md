## About the Project
The **Online Payment Service** is a Django-based web application that simulates a simplified multi-user payment system (similar to PayPal). Through a web interface, registered users can:
- Send money to other users.
- Request money.
- View their transaction history and account balance.

Administrators have additional privileges to view all user transactions, manage user accounts, and promote users to admin status.

The system also integrates:
- A RESTful currency conversion service (to convert a baseline amount in GBP to USD/EUR).
- A remote timestamp service using Apache Thrift, which stamps transactions reliably.

## Built with
- **Backend:** Django, Python
- **Frontend:** HTML, Bootstrap 
- **API & RPC:** Django REST Framework for the currency conversion API; Apache Thrift for the remote timestamp service.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Other Dependencies:** Requests library (for HTTP calls), django-crispy-forms for enhanced form rendering.

## Features
- **User Registration and Authentication:**  
  - Custom registration with email and currency choice.  
  - Automatically computes an initial balance (750 GBP or its converted equivalent) using a RESTful conversion service.  
  - Auto-creation of an initial admin account (`admin1/admin1`) after migrations.  

- **Payments and Payment Requests:**  
  - Direct payment functionality with balance updates and cross-currency conversion.  
  - Payment request functionality that tracks pending requests, with options to accept or reject requests.

- **RESTful Currency Conversion:**  
  - A dedicated REST service converts specified amounts between supported currencies.  
  - This service is integrated into the registration and transaction processes.

- **Transaction History:**  
  - Detailed history of sent and received transactions with proper timestamping.  
  - Conversion details are displayed for cross-currency transactions.

- **Admin Functionality:**  
  - Admin users can view all user accounts and all payment transactions.  
  - They can also promote regular users to admin status.

- **Security and Transaction Management:**  
  - Authentication, authorisation, and secure session management are implemented using Djangoâ€™s built-in features.  
  - All changes occur within atomic database transactions to guarantee ACID properties.  

- **Remote Timestamp Service:**  
  - Integration with a Thrift-based remote timestamp service ensures reliable timing for transactions.  
  - The service runs in a separate daemon thread and is automatically started with the application.

- **Responsive User Interface:**  
  - Designed using Bootstrap 5 for a modern, responsive, and user-friendly experience.
